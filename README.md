# Relative-delay-network-measurement-data
Exploring Latency Correlation in Heterogeneous Multipath Networks
****
Introduce: The data is mainly divided into four parts, the first is the IP data obtained through DNS analysis, the second is the original data obtained through Wireshark packet capture, and the third is the files in the process obtained through the message analysis program, the fourth is the key frame data file divided into IP.
****
1. Files required during the DNS resolution process
## URL.xlsx
The file has a column of data on the first page and the second page, which represents the URL addresses of all NTP servers open on the Internet.
## IP.xlsx
The file has a total of 2+X columns of data, the first column is the number of IP data parsed from the corresponding URL, the second column is the URL address, and the third column is the detailed information of the IP address.
****
2. Raw data
## x.pacp
This file is the raw data captured by wireshark, which can be opened directly by wireshark. Due to upload restrictions, the largest possible data set will be uploaded here, which can still reflect the statistical laws in the paper.
